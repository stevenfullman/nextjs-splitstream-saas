# SplitStream SaaS MVP+ - Phase 1.1 Summary

**Phase Goal:** Establish the foundational project structure, development environment, initial backend/frontend placeholders, database connection setup, and deployment pipeline for the SplitStream SaaS application.

**Overall Project Brief (from TDD):** SplitStream aims to be an automated landing page optimization platform using a multi-armed bandit algorithm. The MVP+ focuses on validating core SaaS functionality (auth, payments, visual element selection, snippet integration, basic MAB, results) using a Next.js API backend and a basic HTML/JS frontend initially, with plans to migrate the frontend to Next.js later.

**Achievements in Sub-phase 1.1 (Tasks 1.1.1 - 1.1.7):**

1.  **1.1.1: Git Repository Setup:**

    -   Completed prior to this phase. The project uses Git and is hosted on GitHub (`stevenfullman/nextjs-splitstream-saas`).

2.  **1.1.2: Project Structure Definition:**

    -   Established the core monorepo structure:
        -   `app/`: Directory created to house the Next.js application (backend API initially, later full-stack).
        -   `dashboard-mvp/`: Directory created for the separate, basic HTML/CSS/JS frontend for the MVP+ phase. Placeholder `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` files were added.
        -   `packages/`: Placeholder directory for future shared code/types.
        -   `public/`: Standard Next.js public assets directory (created within `app/` during Next.js initialization).
        -   `scripts/`: Placeholder directory for utility scripts.

3.  **1.1.3: Local Development Environment Configuration:**

    -   `.nvmrc` file created, specifying Node.js LTS version `lts/iron` (Node 20.x) for consistent Node versions via NVM.
    -   `.npmrc` file created with `engine-strict=true` to enforce Node version compatibility during npm installs (using the `engines` field in `package.json`).
    -   Reference: `project-documentation/task-plan-1.1.3.md`

4.  **1.1.4: Backend Project Initialization (Next.js):**

    -   Initialized a standard Next.js project within the `app/` directory using `create-next-app`.
    -   Configuration included: TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind CSS (for future frontend migration), `src/` directory structure, App Router, npm package manager, and `@/*` import alias.
    -   Added `"engines": { "node": ">=20.0.0" }` to `app/package.json` to align with `.nvmrc` and `.npmrc`.
    -   Adjusted the `app/.gitignore` file to complement the root `.gitignore` and include Next.js specifics.
    -   Reference: `project-documentation/task-plan-1.1.4.md`

5.  **1.1.5: Basic Frontend Dashboard Initialization:**

    -   Populated the `dashboard-mvp/` directory files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`) with minimal valid boilerplate content, linking the CSS and JS files.
    -   Reference: `project-documentation/task-plan-1.1.5.md`

6.  **1.1.6: Supabase Project Setup:**

    -   Created `app/.env.example` outlining required Supabase environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`).
    -   Created `app/.env.local` (ignored by git) for the user to manually input their actual Supabase credentials. **(User confirmed population)**.
    -   Installed the `@supabase/supabase-js` client library into the `app/` Next.js project.
    -   Reference: `project-documentation/task-plan-1.1.6.md`

7.  **1.1.7: Initial Deployment Pipeline Configuration (Vercel):**
    -   Created `vercel.json` in the project root to configure Vercel build settings, specifying the build command and output directory relative to the `app/` subdirectory.
    -   User manually created the Vercel project, linked the GitHub repository, configured the Root Directory to `app/`, added Supabase environment variables (including the secret key), and successfully deployed the initial Next.js application. **(User confirmed successful deployment)**.
    -   Reference: `project-documentation/task-plan-1.1.7.md`

**Conclusion:** Sub-phase 1.1 successfully established the project's foundational structure, development environment configuration, initialized the Next.js backend and basic frontend placeholders, prepared for Supabase integration, and configured a working deployment pipeline on Vercel with HTTPS. The project is now ready to proceed with integrating core SaaS features like authentication (Phase 1.2).
